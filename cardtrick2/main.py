#Input: On the first line of the input is a single positive integer T \le 13 the number of test cases to follow. Each case consists of one line containing the integer n (1 \le n \le 13).

#Output: For each test case, output a line with the correct permutation of the values 1 to n, space separated. The first number showing the top card of the pack, etcâ€¦
